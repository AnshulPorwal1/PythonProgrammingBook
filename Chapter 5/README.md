# Chapter 5 notes
*Challenge 1* - Create a program that prints a list of words in a random order. The program should print all the words and not repeat any.

The player should be able to spend points from the pool on any sttribute and should also be able to take points from an attribute and put them back into the pool.

*Challenge 3* - Write a Who's Your Daddy? program that lets the user enter the name of a male and produces the name of his father. Allow the user to add, replace, and delete son-father pairs.

*Challenge 4* - Improve the Who's Your Daddy? program by adding a choice that lets the user enter a name and get back a grandfather. Your program should still only use one dictionary of son-father pairs. Make sure to include several generations in your dictionary so that  a match can be found.
