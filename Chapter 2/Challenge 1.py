# Chapter 2, Challenge 1
# Create a list of legal and illegal variable names. 
# Describe why each is either legal or illegal. 
# Next, create a list of "good" and "bad" legal variable names. 
# Describe why each is either a good or bad choice for a variable name.

hello = "hello"
Hello = "Hello"
MyNameIs = "MyNameIs is OK - but it's better to start with a lower case"
my_name_is = "my_name_is"
CAPITAL_LETTERS = "Constant variables should be in capital letters."


# Illegal Variable names

# 12345 - starts with a number
# a1234 das - no spaces allowed
# @Â£$! - variable names can only contain numbers, letters and underscores


# Good and bad

# Keep variables short but descriptive.
# Don't start the variable with an underscore - they have a special
# meaning in Python.
# Be consistent!
# Be Pythonic!
