# Chapter 9 Notes

*Challenge 1* - Add some much-needed error checking to the Blackjack game. Before a new round begins, make sure that the deck has enough cards. If not, repopulate and reshuffle it. Find other places where you could add error checking and create the necessary safeguards.

*Challenge 2* - Write a one-card version of the game war, where each player gets a single card and the player with the highest card wins.

*Challenge 3* - Improve the Blackjack project by allowing players to bet. Keep track of each player's bankroll and remove any player who runs out of money.

*Challenge 4* - Create a simple adventure game using objects, where a player can travel between various, connected locations.
