# PythonProgrammingBook
Python Programme for the Absolute Beginner book by Michael Dawson - code for chapters &amp; solutions to challenges.

Note that for the challenges at the end of the chapters, I have not used more advanced code than what has been given previously.
For example, I would not use a try statement before Chapter 7.
