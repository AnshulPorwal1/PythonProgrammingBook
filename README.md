# PythonProgrammingBook
Python Programme for the Absolute Beginner book by Michael Dawson - code for chapters &amp; solutions to challenges.

Notes:
For the challenges at the end of the chapters, in my solutions I have not used more advanced code than that given in the challenge's chapter, or preceding chapters. For example, I would not use a while loop before Chapter 3, or a try statement before Chapter 7.
Solutions to challenges are my own code - I would like to hear feedback on how to improve them (taking the above into account).
