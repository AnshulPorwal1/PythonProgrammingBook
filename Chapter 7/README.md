# Chapter 7 Notes

For Read It.py file - you will also need the file read_it.txt in the same directory as the Read It.py file for it to work.
If you can't make it work (I couldn't at first) you can type the folder directory (where the file is stored) in the Read It.py file before the name of the file - e.g. users/GeorginaDean/Documents/Python/read_it.txt

For Trivia Challenge.py file - you will also need the file trivia_file1.txt

*Challenge 1* - Improve the Trivia Challenge game so that each question has a unique point value associated with it. The player's score should be the total of all the point values of the questions he or she answers correctly.

*Challenge 2* - Improve the Trivia Challenge game so that it maintains a high-scores list in a file. The program should record the player's name and score if the player makes the list. Store the high scores using a pickled object. Uses files trivia_file2.txt and high_scores_pickle.dat. 

*Challenge 3* - Change the way the high-scores functionality you created in the last challenge is implemented. This time, use a plain text file to store the list. Uses files trivia_file2.txt and high_scores1.txt

*Challenge 4* - Create a trivia game episode that tests a player's knowledge of Python files and exceptions. See end of trivia_file1.txt and trivia_file2.txt. Note that to create a new 'episode', you should create a totally new text file, add a title such as 'Trivia for Python files and exceptions' as the first line, and ensure that the references to the trivia_file.txt in the Trivia Challenge.py files are edited to the file name of this episode.
