# Chapter 4 notes
*Challenge 1* - Write a program that counts for the user. Let the user enter the starting number, the ending number, and the amount by which to count.

*Challenge 2* - Create a program that gets a message from the user and then prints it out backwards.

*Challenge 3* - Improve "Word Jumble" so that each word it paired with a hint. The player should be able to see the hint if he or she is stuck. Add a scoring system that rewards players who solve a jumble without asking for a hint.

*Challenge 4* - Create a game where the computer picks a random word and the player has to guess that word. The computer tells the player how many letters are in the word. Then the player gets five chances to ask if a letter is in the word. The computer can only respond with "yes" or "no". Then, the player must guess the word.
